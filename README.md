# Jarvis
Just a Rather Very Intelligent System running on llama2 100% offline

Get your on personal assitant runing locally with ollama on llama2

To-Do:

- [ ] Fine-tune llama2-7b for a costum model `Llama-2-7b-chat-jarvis"`(WIP)
- [ ] Build a proper voice clone of jarvis(In progress): currently having difficulties finding clean voice samples of jarvis on the internet, so working with what i have, i guess won't be perfect.
- [ ] Integrate with a fine-tuned version of any open source LLM out there, like Llama 2 or Mistral AI etc
- [ ] Use Whisper for voice to text input(if anyone has anything better, please suggest as this is the best i found out there.)
- [ ] Deploy the voice model as an API for everyone to be able to use it(We can deploy on my vps i don't know, if the specs will even let us though, we'll see)
